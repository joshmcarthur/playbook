# Playbook

I am a developer. I make mistakes, but I learn from them. When I identify something that I do consistently, I document it here. This is my playbook.

### Running locally

`bundle install` will install dependencies. There are no Node.js dependencies.
`bundle exec jekyll serve` will start a development server on port 4000.

### Deploying

This site is deployed with Github Pages. Pushing to the `master` branch, either
manually or via a pull request, will trigger a new deployment.

### Contributions

Content provided here is my own opinion, and may be biased or incorrect. I welcome contributions that clarify wording or address spelling or grammatical
mistakes.

This playbook is my own and is not intended to be a repository of shared knowledge - it is specific to my experiences. As such, contributions of new content are unlikely to be accepted. If there is a topic that is not covered that you feel should be, please [open an issue](/issues/new).
