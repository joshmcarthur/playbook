## Remote work

It's important to me that I am _capable_ of working productively from
home or somewhere else that is not work. This helps me to work on a range
of communication skills, and also introduces flexibility into the types of
roles and positions I can take. If I am able to work remotely, I have many options for movement between clients and potentially roles.

Working productively is my key metric for remote work. I consider productive 
remote work to be approximately the same rate of delivery as working at the 
office - I expect a decrease in productivity from home distractions, offset
by an increase in productivity from less work distractions.

The most important aspect of remote work for me is **balance**. I find it difficult to disengage with a task if it is incomplete, so I try and work very consistently. 

I ensure that my work day, even remotely, is consistent. This means that I get up, I go through the exact same routine I would if I was going to a physical office, and I work mostly the same hours of the day - from 8am to 4-5pm. 

My current role affords some flexibility so long as client work is not disrupted. Because of this, I often try and find opportunities to exercise during the day. I am most productive at the very start and very end of the day, so taking an hour to exercise mid-afternoon usually results in a better quality of work day overall.

I am natually inclined to prefer time to myself, but also recognise that this is
not healthy on a full-time basis. I ensure that when lockdown restrictions (will) allow, that I find opportunities to engage with others, such as:

* Visiting a local coffee shop 
* Facilitating non-meeting virtual or in-person social catchups (currently via Zoom). 
* Attending community meet-ups - usually not development-focussed ones. (when restrictions allow).

Working from home can be very fulfilling for me. I do take care to ensure that 
my work day at home generally expends the same amount of effort that a work day 
at the office would take, so as to ensure that I do not burn out and maintain a
healthy balance of time spent away from my work.

## Exercise

Work-life balance is incredibly important to me. Being involved in such a 
rich and fast-pased industry means that it's easy to stay permanently connected
to what is happening in the development community. I recognise that works for some people, but does not for me. Having burned out several times in the past, I am learning to recognise the signs of burn out in myself, and to structure the times when I am working to prevent it from starting in the first place.

Exercise has been the most beneficial component of my work-life balance. While I have always been involved in camping and hiking all over New Zealand, more local activities has given me opportunities to incorporate exercise into my daily routine. Currently, my exercise activities include running (trail & jogging), cycling (light road & trail), and at-home exercises. I appreciate the benefit gyms provide, but personally I'm more comfortable exercising on my own. 

I aim to hit about a 1 hour exercise slot per day, and usually allow myself one break day. My exercise when working at the office is exclusively running around Thorndon and Kelburn in Wellington City. My exercise at home can be more varied,with safe running & cycling trails nearby, as well as the paved paths around my suburb. 

I am also a dog owner, which means daily walks - I treat these as an opportunity to have some time to ponder over a problem I am stuck on or to just have a chance to zone out, rather than as an exercise opportunity. Long walks (> 2 hours) usually replace a shorter, more intensive cardio activity for the day.

Exercise gives me a chance to step away from my work, and in fact all aspects of my day, and have a mental and physical change of pace. I almost exclusively listen to podcasts while exercising, rather than music. Usually these are not technical podcasts, but instead cover other specialist interests - history, medicine, engineering and a range of lighter comedic ones. Unless I'm particularly in the mood for it, technical podcasts don't give me enough of a break from my work, so I tend to pick and choose these based on those of interest to me.

## Tools & techniques

I find it difficult to swith between tasks, so nearly all of the tools and techniques I find myself using relate to concentration.

The most important factor to me being able to complete a task successfully is adequate planning. Without a good work plan for myself, I find it easy to get distracted or stuck on a particular decision, and then feel unable to proceed.

I try and get rid of distractions. The most significant distraction is Slack. I have already dialled down on notifications from most channels, but closing it altogether is a good way to have some time to keep a bunch of context in my head.

I use the Pomodoro technique occasionally, but not always. I usually reach for this technique when I am in a distractable mood, to keep myself on task, as this allows me opportunities to have breaks to be distracted.

I use Google Tasks to record single-line topics that I would like to investigate, or actual tasks to complete. I try and do this rather than jumping down rabbit holes in the middle of doing something else. I have found Tasks particularly good for noting down things I should document or write about - e.g. if I find a handy Ruby method.

## Hardware

I used to use a Macbook Pro. Apple hardware remains unparalleled for developers, but the OS stopped working for me.

I currently use a Lenovo T480 as my laptop for both personal and professional work. Lenovo allows for significant customisation of their hardware. I opted for the following configuration:

* Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz
* 16GB DDR4 RAM (I can add an additional 16GB in the future with a free slot for it).
* Larger 72Wh battery - Lenovo Thinkpads already come with a secondary battery allowing for hot-swapping, but the extra capacity battery gives me enough to get through up to 4 hours of Google Meet or other video conferencing - or, a full day of normal development.
* Smaller battery - I later got this battery as well - it makes the laptop a bit more compact and lighter, which is better for travelling.
* 512GB M.2 NVMe SSD
* No WWAN - even though the ThinkPad supports it, I don't work away from Wifi enough to justify needing a 4G connection. I later managed to find a 512GB SSD that would fit into the WWAN card slot, giving me a second 512GB slot. 

The above configuration came to around USD$1,300 - a bit less than the equivalent Macbook, but with a much larger battery, larger disk, and the opportunity to take off the back and replace components in the future, at the expense of hardware quality.

I pair this with a [ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 dock](https://support.lenovo.com/nz/en/solutions/acc100356), which allows me to have a displayport and an HDMI monitor connected, as well as keyboard & mouse, USB charging cables, USB headset and 3.5mm headphones. All of these periphials connect to the Thinkpad with a single connection - a Thunderbolt 3 cable. This also charges my laptop. At the time, I felt that the dock was more expensive than was justified, however I would struggle without it now. It's significantly easier to plug in and get stuck into work without a bunch of distraction, and equally easy to unplug if I need to relocate.

I use a [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard, connected via USB - Bluetooth is supported, but I've never had a good time with Bluetooth keyboards working consistently all the time. 

I also use a [Logitech M570 trackball mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/wireless-trackball-m570). I've never had particular ergonomic problems, but I do find the trackball more comfortable to use, and since the mouse itself doesn't need to be moved around on the surface, it's easier to use on a messy desk. 

I have a USB headset for video calls - if my work didn't provide one, I would buy one myself - they make remote meetings much easier. The particular model I have is the Logitech H390. The hardware mute switch is especially useful since I can use it as a push-to-talk button, without having to switch applications back to the call to unmute.

I have a couple of pairs of headphones, but nothing fancy. I have a several-years old Logitech U9000 that is permanently out of battery, so has no noise cancelling or bluetooth, and a pair of noise cancelling headphones from Kmart that were NZD$25 - the sound quality is not the best, but the noise cancelling is surprisingly good, so I usually use these ones as earmuffs. 

On the go, I have Xiaomi Airdots, which are fantastic TWS for the price (about NZD$30). The battery lasts ages, I've dropped them on hard surfaces and into water a bunch of times, and the sound is pretty good. These are good enough that while I'm still on my first pair, I've got a backup pair permananently standing by. 

Other hardware is unexciting - Google Pixel 2XL phone, and I've been through a range of attempts at a casual fitness watch, having gone from Pebble (good, cheap, ugly watch with no onboard music support or GPS but long battery life), to Amazfit Bip (basically a great Pebble replacement - still ugly, good battery life, no onboard music support, but has GPS that occasionally finds satellites), to Fossil Gen 4 (I'm sure it's a good Android wear watch, but I can't have a watch that lasts < 12 hours), back to the Bip, and now have a Garmin Venu, which I think is going to stick. The battery life is worse than the Pebble and Bip at 2-3 days, but is much better than Android Wear, and the Garmin supports onboard music & podcasts as well as really really good fitness tracking. 

## Software

 I initially ran Ubuntu 19.10, but switched to Pop OS due to it's slightly
more polished user interface and focus on desktop/laptop experience. I'm really happy with Pop OS, it works well.

I use Flatpak apps when I can, otherwise falling back to docker, apt and snap. I used to use snap apps more, but ran into some pretty bad performance problems.

I run applications in Docker when they have very particular requirements, or 
dependencies on other services or applications. I otherwise usually have everything I need to run a normal (for me, Rails or Node) application installed locally. I do run all my services - Postgres, Redis, Solr, etc. in Docker containers that are port-mapped to the normal localhost port - 5432, 6379, etc. 

I use VS Code, and seem to toggle vim mode on or off every other week. I have used vim in the past, but the UI of VS Code is unbeatable. I still use vim for quick edits or dealing with large files, or files that VS Code isn't handling for some reason. 

I use Chrome. Idealogically I would prefer Firefox, but I am so attuned to using Chrome now that I have not yet managed to switch. My house is also full of things that can be cast to, which Chrome is very good at supporting. 

I run my backups to Backblaze B2 using restic. I used to use Duplicity & S3, but Duplicity didn't back up particularly quickly, and S3 was becoming expensive, because bandwidth. The bandwidth wasn't expensive so much because of laptop backups, but I have a Google Takeout backup scheduled quarterly, and that was costing a few dollars each time, wheras incoming bandwidth was free on B2. I use autorestic to configure my backups using a YAML configuration file.

I use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) for managing versions of _everything_, including Ruby, Node, Elixir, Erlang and Flutter. It's a great tool, and has completely replaced RVM, chruby, rbenv, nvm and all those others for me. I wish it was able to pick up the configuration files of other tools to decide what version of Ruby or Node.js to use, but that's a minor quibble. 

All of my other shell, vim, IRB - basically anything command-line-ish I keep in [my dotfiles](http://github.com/joshmcarthur/dotfiles). I keep intending on switching my dotfiles repo to use [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), but for now my dotfiles are handy jumble of configuration files, shell scripts, and aliases.
