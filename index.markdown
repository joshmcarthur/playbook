# I am a developer. I make mistakes, but I learn from them. When I identify something that I do consistently, I document it here.

# **This is my playbook.**
{: .text-yellow-000 }

Use the nav to explore high-level topics. Within each of these topics there
are sub-topics. 

Each page has a commit history, which you can view using the 'Changelog' 
link at the bottom of each page.

This playbook is open source! The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/joshmcarthur/playbook). The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) was also considered for this, but I preferred Jekyll's ability to put content front-and-center, at the expense of a built-in webpack plugin.

The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and served via [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/).

The [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto/) font is used for pricipal 
typography. Stylesheets are compiled with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

This guide is heavily inspired by [Thoughtbot's Playbook](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook), but the content is my own.
