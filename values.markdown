### I want to do good in the world.

My overall satisfaction is based upon the value I provide to others,
and to help those who need it, either directly or indirectly. I consider 
how the things that I build, and the way that I build them, impact others.

### I prefer and support open tools and processes.

I appreciate the collective effort represented by open tools
and processes, and the transparency they bring. Wherever I can,
I advocate both using and creating open tooling and processes throughout
my own personal development and the organisations I am part of.

### I give back to my community.

I contribute everything that I can back to the community. I help others
where I can, and do my best to support those around me to do the same. I recognise the degree to which my skills rely on documentation, examples, 
libraries and frameworks that have been created by others, and do my best
to try and create similar artifacts myself for others to use in kind.

### I share my knowledge with others

I have learned, and am learning constantly, from those
around me - physically, in my industry, and those who I come into contact
with in a miriad of ways.  When I learn something that could be useful to others, I strive to communicate. This can come in the form of mentoring, blogs,
conversation or any other format - so long as it is shared.
