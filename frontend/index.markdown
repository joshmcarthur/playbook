* Maybe still use a preprocessor?
* Assess frontend style libraries extremely critically
* Use React when you have a piece of state to manage
* React contexts are good
* Redux is complicated
* You don't need jQuery
* Static site deployment
* Lighthouse for audits
* PWA by default
* There might be something between vanilla JS and React?
* Build an SPA when you know it's needed, not before
